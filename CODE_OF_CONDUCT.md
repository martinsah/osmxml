# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of 
experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or 
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive and healthy community. Interactions within the project 
should abide to those guidelines and discussions should stir away from the topics
aforementioned.

## Our Standards

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or 
    advances of any kind
*   Trolling used as means to harass, insulting/derogatory comments,
    and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission.
*   Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in
    which it occurs.

All discussions and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior 
which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.

## Owner's Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior 
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances 
of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code 
of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they 
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful..

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad 
day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances 
such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate 
escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve 
conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate 
further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation 
strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a
    real-time medium.
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to
    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Enforcement

If the project team receives a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, 
they will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss 
the report before a sanction is issued. The project team will do their utmost to keep 
the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), 
or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the project team may 
issue sanctions without notice.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement through [INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict 
resolution policy before submitting a report.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter of any incident.
